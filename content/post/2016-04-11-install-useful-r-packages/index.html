<p>About once a semester, I end up having to install or reinstall R because of a software issue, OS upgrade, or some other calamity. It’s calmed down in the past year or two, but it used to be much more frequent. During grad school, I was screwing things up on such a regular basis that I could reinstall Ubuntu, get LaTeX and R installed, and repopulate all of the important programs I used faster than I could usually fix the issue I caused initially (and for the most part, I was doing this without docker or any of the convenient tools we have now for automatically setting up environments).</p>
<p>For a week or two after a new installation, though, I’d be constantly having to install R packages I forgot existed until some code didn’t work. It was obnoxious enough that I wrote a <a href="/code/InstallPackages.R">script to make things faster</a>, and kept a <a href="/data/Packages.csv">csv file of packages</a> (which may or not be necessary at this point, but it’s there and the code uses it so w/e. )</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Essential R packages
