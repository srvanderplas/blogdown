Note: (2019/04/11) A few weeks ago, the ISU Graphics group had a group presentation including the worst graphics we all could find. I've decided to keep a list of my own, many of which were stolen from various places around the web, including [/r/dataisbeautiful](https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful) and  [/r/dataisugly](https://reddit.com/r/dataisugly). 


1. The line graph of pie charts of varying size.

2. A 3D stacked scatter-pie-column chart.

3. A stacked area chart with double-encoding... colors and textures, in enough combinations to make your eyes bleed.

5. Time series via pie chart    
I agree with the [reddit comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/5zbu14/how_much_marijuana_must_be_made_to_give_to_128_of/)... 100% of people making this chart had to be stoned.

8. Snowfall in Des Moines

With a remade version that doesn't have dual axes:    
`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 1098705251434221568 >}}")`    

9. Pie charts in a map    
If you're thinking about combining a pie chart with anything other than a pie... rethink.
