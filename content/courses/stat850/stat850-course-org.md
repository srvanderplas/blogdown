This course will be structured as a "flipped" classroom. This means, in part, 

- You'll be reading and working through the material that would have been a "lecture" at home, before class.
- When we're in class, we'll work on homework, activities, or examples that allow you to use the material you've learned in an active way.
- In class work will often be done in groups or pairs (as much as is practical given social distancing rules)

My hope is that this structure will let us make the most of any in-person time we get, while still maintaining the content of the course should we need to go all-online (or should any members of the class need to quarantine or work off-campus due to medical issues). 

Now, I am not expecting that you will fully "teach yourself" this material. 

I've written a "textbook" - it's in snark-quotes because it's essentially what I would want to say if I were teaching this portion of the class in person.

<details><summary>About the textbook</summary>
It's more-or-less a transcript of how I'd teach the class, including the snarky comments, relevant cartoons, and informal side-notes (I've tried to confine those to footnotes, though.) Think of the textbook as a lecture without all of the annoying pauses and awkward droning voice. I spent my summer writing this thing, so hopefully it is useful. If you find typos, or see something that's wrong or questionable, please email me so that I can fix it. This was written without an editor, and spell check doesn't always work so well when code is involved.

Video lectures aren't (in my opinion) particularly helpful with programming, because having someone speak code at you isn't necessarily that useful. I will post live coding videos for certain things, but in general I think it's more useful for you to work through material at your own pace and without my annoying voice in the background. :)
</details>

There are "try it out" sections after (almost) every chunk of important programming-related material in the textbook. You should actively participate in your learning using these sections -- ideally, fully attempting to answer the question yourself before you look at the answers.

<details><summary>Why this matters.</summary>
It's a lot easier to read code and think you understand it than it is to write the code from scratch, but you only learn the material by writing the code and making mistakes. Keep your textbook open in a browser window and have RStudio or SAS open at the same time - that way, you can go back and forth, try code out, change things, see what happens, and learn!

I've hidden the answers to the try it out sections in expandable sections like this one, so that you're not *as* tempted to immediately look at the answers when you get stuck.

**I'm also planning to post short video clips of demonstrating some tasks**, so that you can see any information that requires a graphical interface, as well as seeing someone code in real time. 

**I'm available for office hours** via Zoom or in-person appointments (subject to the current university rules, which are ever-changing). [Use this link to make an appointment](https://calendly.com/vanderplas/stat-850-office-hours) (appointments auto-update with my availability). You can also reach out via Canvas or email if you have a question or issue and want to resolve it asynchronously. 

In addition to the textbook portion of the course, there are a couple of other ways to engage with the material -- and these are things that I can actually assess in a reasonable way. 

**Class discussions**. Most modules will include a discussion component using YellowDig. I'll post a page to the canvas module describing the topic and providing any reading material; you'll make posts (and respond to your classmates' posts). You'll need to meet a weekly discussion participation target in YellowDig to get full participation points. 

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
I want you to engage with your classmates, even though the class may not include in-person interaction in the same way that pre-pandemic classes might have worked. Discussions are also a way to get at the open-ended types of assignments that aren't easily graded via a rubric. Some of the skills in programming are things like reading documentation, assessing software package options, and knowing how to ask good questions. Those aren't easily explored via a homework assignment, but may be easier to develop and assess through discussions. I don't ask that your comments always be completely correct - I just want to see evidence that you're thinking about the topics we are covering in class. 
</details>

**Assignments**. There will be weekly assignments, which will hopefully be done during class time. These assignments are designed to give you practice with the material, and to help you develop the skills you'll need to work with data effectively.


<details><summary>Work together on assignments!</summary>
You're welcome (and encouraged) to work in groups on assignments, so long as everyone is contributing. In most cases, you will be submitting an individual assignment, so your assignment should not be a direct copy of someone else's. Learning to program with other people makes it much easier and less frustrating. There's not a good socially distanced substitute for your neighbor leaning over and saying "hey, you misspelled your variable name" when debugging a problem. [Even extremely experienced software developers benefit from another pair of eyes occasionally - read the responses if you need more proof.](https://twitter.com/pjf/status/1133860698289688579?s=20)
</details>

**Final Project**. In broad strokes, you'll take a dataset of your choice and use the things you've learned in this class to do something interesting and fun with it. We'll talk more about it later, but you can start looking for a fun or interesting data set now.

<details><summary>Explanation</summary>
I'd rather give you a project than have to write one or more exams that can be done in 2 hours and are reasonable representations of the real world. Real data work takes time, and any test that simulates real conditions (where you can access online resources, friends, reference materials, etc.) is essentially a homework assignment.

The goal is to make this a very hands-on, practical class. The requirements of social distancing and COVID mean that the structure of the class is perhaps different than it would have been under normal circumstances, but I hope this structure will make the most of any in-person time that we have. 
***

On a personal note: I have pretty severe asthma and chronic bronchitis. Under normal circumstances, I just come to work anyways, cough a lot, drink a lot of tea, and eat cough drops constantly. That strategy is unworkable and irresponsible during a global pandemic when the virus in question results in similar symptoms to my "normal". I'm anticipating that there will be times when I am not allowed to come to campus because of my cough, even though I had the same symptoms at the same time last year. That's one of the many reasons I've designed this class this way - I have to prepare for the fact that I may not be able to teach in person 100% of the time. My plan is to hold class via Zoom on days that I can't come to campus, but I expect plans will change as the semester progresses.

I also may be doing double duty as a professor and a mom at some points this semester if daycare shuts down or becomes too risky. I know the past few months have taxed everyone's ability to keep work and family separate, so if you are dealing with similar challenges, I will do my best to accommodate you, and I hope you'll be similarly tolerant of kid interruptions on my end.
